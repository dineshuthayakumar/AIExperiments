            "While the Kissflow documentation doesn't explicitly state a hard limit on the number of sub-items, **it's generally not recommended to add 200 sub-items to a single item.**\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's why, and what you should consider instead:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Performance and Usability:** Having that many sub-items can significantly degrade performance, especially when loading, updating, and navigating within the parent item. It becomes difficult to manage and track that much detail within a single view. Kissflow is likely optimized for a more manageable number of sub-items. Think of it from a user experience perspective: scrolling through 200 sub-items to find a specific one would be extremely cumbersome.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Organization and Clarity:** 200 sub-items likely indicate that the parent item is too broad and needs to be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks or projects. You're likely trying to pack too much functionality into a single Board item.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Alternative Solutions:** Kissflow likely offers better methods for managing complex projects with many individual tasks. Consider these options:\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   **Breaking Down the Parent Item:** Instead of having one item with 200 sub-items, create multiple parent items, each with a smaller, more manageable number of sub-items (e.g., 10-20). This makes it easier to track progress, assign responsibilities, and keep the board organized.\n",
            "    *   **Using Multiple Boards:** If the tasks are distinct enough, consider using multiple Kissflow Boards to categorize and organize the different aspects of the project.\n",
            "    *   **Automated Workflows:** If the creation or management of sub-items can be automated, explore using Kissflow's workflow automation capabilities to handle some of the repetitive tasks. This can reduce the need to manually create and manage a large number of sub-items.\n",
            "    *   **Integrations:** Explore integrations with other project management tools that might be better suited for handling such a large number of tasks. Kissflow can often integrate with these tools, allowing you to manage different aspects of the project in different platforms.\n",
            "    *  **Using Categories/Tags:** Perhaps you can use a category or tag system to further define the board item instead of using subitems.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Recommendation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Contact Kissflow support directly to confirm if there's a hard limit on sub-items per item. However, regardless of a hard limit, **reconsider your approach.**  Break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. Focus on creating a clear and organized workflow using Kissflow's built-in features and consider integrations if necessary. Think about *why* you need 200 sub-items. Is it truly necessary, or is there a better way to structure the project within Kissflow's capabilities?\n",
