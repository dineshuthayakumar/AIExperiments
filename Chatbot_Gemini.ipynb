            "Unfortunately, the Kissflow community documentation doesn't explicitly state whether you can add custom fields directly to *sub-items* within Kissflow Boards. However, based on general knowledge and the capabilities of similar platforms, it's **likely possible, but with some caveats and limitations.**\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a breakdown of why and what you should consider:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Why it's likely possible:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **General Customization:** Kissflow is known for its customization capabilities. It allows you to define custom fields for the main items (cards) within a board.  Extending this functionality to sub-items would align with this general philosophy.\n",
            "* **Hierarchical Data Structures:** Often, platforms that support sub-items also allow for specific data attributes to be assigned to them.  This allows for more granular tracking and management of the sub-item tasks.\n",
            "* **Purpose of Sub-items:** Sub-items are usually used to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable components.  Each of these components might require its own set of specific data points.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Caveats and Limitations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Plan Dependency:** The availability of custom fields on sub-items might depend on your Kissflow plan.  Higher-tier plans often unlock more advanced customization features.\n",
            "* **Direct vs. Indirect Approach:** There might not be a straightforward \"add custom field to sub-item\" button.  Instead, you might need to use a workaround or a specific feature designed for this purpose. This might involve:\n",
            "    * **Lookup Fields/Relationships:** Creating a separate form or list specifically for sub-items and then linking it to the main item using a lookup field.  This allows you to attach a sub-item \"record\" with its own custom fields to each main item.\n",
            "    * **Conditional Logic:**  Using conditional logic within the main item form to display or hide sub-item specific fields based on certain criteria.  This isn't ideal, but could work if the sub-item data is directly related to the parent item.\n",
            "* **Reporting Limitations:** How easily you can report on these sub-item custom fields might be limited.  Kissflow's reporting capabilities might not fully extend to deeply nested data.\n",
            "\n",
            "**How to Confirm (Recommended Steps):**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Directly Check Kissflow Boards:**  The best way to confirm is to log into your Kissflow account and navigate to the Boards section.  Try creating a board and adding a sub-item.  Look for options to customize the sub-item fields.  Check for buttons that says \"Add Field\" or similar.\n",
            "2. **Contact Kissflow Support:** This is the most reliable approach.  Reach out to Kissflow support (likely through their in-app help or website) and ask specifically if you can add custom fields to sub-items within Boards and how to do so.  They can also clarify any plan-specific limitations.\n",
            "3. **Explore Kissflow Forums:**  While the documentation is silent on this, it's possible other users have discussed this topic in the Kissflow community forums.  Search the forums using keywords like \"custom fields sub-items boards.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "**In summary, while it's highly *likely* that you can add some form of custom data to sub-items in Kissflow Boards, confirm the exact method and limitations with Kissflow support to ensure it meets your specific needs.**\n",
